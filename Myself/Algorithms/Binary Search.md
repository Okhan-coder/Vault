Think of this algorithm as a hot cold finder. You cut the algorithm in half each time it runs. It uses 3 pointers left right and middle. If the value is less then middle that you can assume its between mid and left so update accordingly.


Run-Time
O(log n)
Log is the opposite of exponents constantly shrinking
The bigger the number the less magnitude of increase in  the run time due to log
