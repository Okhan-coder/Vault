If going for a Microsoft shop:

- Hyper-V / vSphere (I recommend learning both)
    
- AD
    
- Azure AD (look up the Office 365 Developer program)
    
- Office 365 for mail (see above)
    
- Setup DHCP with failover
    
- Do everything in PowerShell, no GUI
    
- Veeam like [u/8-16_account](https://www.reddit.com/user/8-16_account/) mentioned (google their NFR license)
    
- Use Veeam for Office 365 too (backups are important for everything, don't rely on third parties)
    

If Linux or DevOps or other:

- Okta (look up their dev program)
    
- Setup a vSphere cluster
    
- Setup RHEL VMs
    
- Check out RHEL IPA but really lean more towards Okta/Azure AD
    
- Setup Docker and some containers
    
- Setup Kubernetes and some pods
    
- Setup DHCP/DNS with failover
    
- Use PiHole for DNS as a docker container or kubernetes pod
    
- Setup a wiki as a docker container or kubernetes pod (lots of wiki options, pick any of them)
    
- Same Veeam stuff as above
