### What is a data-Structure
Arrangements of addresses and memory in RAM with different strategies to access data 

Bits is  the fundamental building block of these Structures

What is a bit? A bit is a 0 or 1 the binary that CPU's read to execute commands

Different Data types are coordinated to different bits for example 5 in PURE binary is 101 or C in binary is 011

Usually RAM is comprised of Bytes which is 8 Bits

Each section of memory has addresses

==Questions?:==
Does memory addresses have a limit whats the smallest address? 
Where are these addresses Stored?
What is Virtual Memory?
How does Heap and Stack work?
RAM to CPU?
Caches? 

### Arrays 
Arrays are one of the most simple Data Structs you will encounter

You can think of RAM as a giant array because its a **contiguous** block of memory

Memory allocation might be different

Type of Array have different sizes of bytes
Int is 8 bytes
Char is 1 byte etc 

###### Static Array

Arrays cannot change memory size once given 
Biggest limitation

If i-th is known Read/Write/Insert O(1)
If Insert/Remove with filled O(N)
